    description: "This project is run as a weekly extramural activity for disadvantaged youth from one of the local schools. Our main goal is to keep the children occupied and off the streets after school. The project promotes physical activity as a positive outlet for energy. Volunteers help us teach the youth valuable life lessons through adventure activities, teamwork, educational classes, and sports such as swimming and surfing. The children that cannot swim yet, receive swimming lessons. Those that have already mastered this vital skill, are given the opportunity to learn how to surf. For most of the children this is the highlight of their day, which is why we also use it as an incentive for them to do well in school, giving them a better chance at a brighter future. Those that turn up for school every day, behave themselves in class and study hard, will rewarded by going swimming or surfing after school. As the project is used as an incentive, we have noticed a drastic decrease in the drop-out rate for these students from a local school.",

We take their safety very serious, swimming classes are always joined by a supervisor of Local Dreamers. The Swimming School project is a great joy for both the children as the volunteers.

Most of these children are runaways from home, due to physical abuse and poverty. Many are orphans, who have no relatives to live with, and are forced by misfortune to live such a life. These children can be seen scavenging the rubbish heap for a meal, sleeping between the tracks, often beaten and sexually abused, falling prey to drug peddlers and child traffickers. Through extensive volunteer work in the street children program in India - Delhi this situation can be tried to be dealt with. Volunteers work at the various contact points or shelter homes, being run by various organizations, which serve as day care centers for these street children. ",

As a result, many orphanages were established to help raise the Cambodian youth. Even though the wars have ended, many children are sent to live at these centers due to their family’s poverty and because their parents hope they will receive good education in the orphanage. We want to try our best to support families so that they can keep their children at home and want to do our best to help the children who are living in a child care centers already. This program is organized for everyone who loves and enjoys working with children. Volunteers working in center help with general work. The type of work and working hours depend on the location and the project that the volunteer is participating in. Typically volunteers work for 4-6 hours per day. Depending on your individual interests and skills, and on the needs of the local staff, your daily activities might include caring for children, playing games, help them with their homework, teaching English, drawing pictures, teaching geography or sports, singing and learning songs with the children or create activities for the kids. Volunteer also to help with practical tasks like preparing meals and cleaning up. In most of our placements the children are attending relevant public schools. They also have fixed activities, such as learning about the Khmer language, culture, and health; playing games and sports; reading, practicing traditional Khmer dance and sometimes discussing topics like moralist.",

The work undertaken during this gorilla conservation tour is essential in bridging the gap between indigenous communities and the gorillas who share their vulnerable rainforest homes. As a volunteer, you will not only be able to actively contribute to the on-going protection of these incredible creatures, but will also be able to experience them roaming freely in their natural habitat. Your gorilla trekking tours will take place in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park - a sanctuary that is home to half of the world's critically endangered mountain gorillas. Here you will collaborate with the local communities on reforestation efforts and will work towards educating these communities on the importance of gorilla conservation.",

The farm not just a home but a Sanctuary; we house animals that have been hurt, mistreated, or that need to be relocated. Animals that are not able to be relocated or released, will live their lives in peace on the farm. Our goal is to raise the big cats that we have as naturally as possible so that they can be released into the wild, where they will be re-populating a diminishing population. Some cubs will be kept at the program as ambassadors that will help to educate people the importance of our animals!",

Vegetable and Herb Patch - we want to expand the patch so we can produce our own food for our staff and volunteers. Setting up infrastructure is essential as we also want this area to be a place where people can sit on benches or do picnics. Planting and watering will also be required and any experience with organic farming would be great as all our produce uses zero pesticides.",

The next day volunteers will scuba dive and arrange these structures under water, between 6-8m, where they will provide habitats to a wide variety of marine species.

    description: "CTL Ireland collaborates with a well-established organisation that operates over 20 centres in Ireland to support people with special needs. The organisation provides a range of support services to people with both physical and mental conditions. The aim of the organisation is to provide quality, person-centred services, which facilitate people with disabilities to live a life of their own choosing. CTL collaborates with different projects across the country. Many of the residents have long-term physical disabilities. These disabilities do not prevent service users from leading independent lives in the community. ",
